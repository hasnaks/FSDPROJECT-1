### Project Description
[🛸 Time Travel Machine
A funny, useless React app where you pick a year and “time travel” with a cool animation and sarcastic messages. Features random quirky travel logs, a reset button with a funny present message, and a fake chatbot with snarky past/future replies.
Styled in neon cyberpunk and sepia tones with glitch effects. All text is hardcoded—no real data,just fun.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People want a high-tech time travel experience but don’t want to deal with boring facts or real data. Existing apps are either too serious or complicated. This app solves that by offering a fun, silly, and totally useless “time travel” experience with sarcastic messages and quirky humor—no real info, just laughs.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[By building a flashy “time machine” that looks high-tech but does absolutely nothing useful! Pick a year, watch a trippy wormhole animation, then get hilarious fake messages and weird travel logs. Chat with a snarky bot stuck in the past or future. It’s all jokes, no facts — perfect for wasting time with style!]

]
*The screen recording shows a humorous walkthrough of the “Tornare” web app. The user starts by picking a year from a list of quirky historical events, then activates the “Time Travel” feature. A glowing portal animation plays before they arrive in 1985, greeted with a comedic message about meeting Doc Brown. The journey continues with the Temporal Chat Assistant, where the user exchanges witty messages with characters from different eras—like someone from the medieval period poking fun at modern worries about WiFi. The entire experience blends time travel fantasy with light-hearted jokes.*
